PLEASE READ ENTIRELY

This file serves as the ReadMe for the Social Analytics using Graph Databases.

I have decided to use Python as my programming language and also neo4j as a graph database.


In order to run these python scripts you have to have the project directory with the facebook dataset folder at the
same level as the scripts.  There is dependency on this directory format in order to successfully obtain the correct
results.

I have seperated the four requirements into the perspective file names:

Number of nodes - NumberOfNodes.py
Number of edges - NumberOfEdges.py
Clustering coef - ClusteringCoefficient.py
Betweeness Cent - BetweenessCentrality.py

Once you enter the file name after the python command you will be prompted for a social circle id which correlates
to the id within the facebook datasets. The options are as follows:
options 0, 107, 348, 414, 686, 1684, 1912, 3437, 3980:
I recommend using 3980 because the others take quite awhile due to the amount of data.

You will also be asked to provide your neo4j username and password for your neo4j server that you must download on your
local machine.
